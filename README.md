# Unicorn.eth PolyPrize Collection - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy a soul-bound NFT collection on Polygon using ThirdWeb tools.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Required Accounts & Tools
- [ThirdWeb Dashboard Account](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)
- Polygon wallet with MATIC for gas fees
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Git

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create new React project
npx create-react-app unicorn-polyprize-dapp
cd unicorn-polyprize-dapp

# Install ThirdWeb dependencies
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/chains

# Install additional dependencies
npm install tailwindcss
```

## Step 1: Contract Deployment

### Option A: Using ThirdWeb Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# Install ThirdWeb CLI
npm install -g @thirdweb-dev/cli

# Initialize new contract project
npx thirdweb create contract

# Choose:
# - Contract name: UnicornPolyPrizeCollection
# - Framework: Hardhat
# - Base contract: ERC721Base
```

### Option B: Manual Deployment via ThirdWeb Dashboard
1. Go to [ThirdWeb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Deploy Contract"
3. Choose "ERC721" → "ERC721Base"
4. Customize with the provided contract code
5. Deploy to Polygon network

### Contract Constructor Parameters
```
Base Image URI: "https://your-domain.com/unicorn-image.png" or "ipfs://QmYourImageHash"
Drawing Date: 1735689599 (Unix timestamp - e.g., Dec 31, 2024 23:59:59 UTC)
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Base Image URI**: Single image used for all NFTs (IPFS recommended for permanence)
- **Drawing Date**: Unix timestamp when minting ends
- **Max Supply**: Hard-coded to 10,000 NFTs in contract
- **On-Chain Metadata**: All metadata generated on-chain, no external API needed

**Setting Drawing Date:**
```javascript
// Calculate Unix timestamp for your drawing date
const drawingDate = new Date('2024-12-31T23:59:59Z').getTime() / 1000;
console.log(drawingDate); // Use this value in constructor
```

## Step 2: Image Hosting (Simplified)

### Why Only One Image?
The updated contract uses a **single image for all NFTs**, making deployment much simpler:
- No complex metadata API needed
- All metadata generated on-chain
- Reduces hosting costs and complexity
- Ensures permanent availability

- 

### Option A: IPFS (Recommended for Permanence)
```bash
# Upload your unicorn image to IPFS
# Use Pinata, Infura, or local IPFS node
# Example result: "ipfs://QmYourUnicornImageHash"
```

### Option B: Traditional Web Hosting
```bash
# Upload single image to your web server
# Example: "https://yourdomain.com/unicorn-polyprize.png"
# Ensure high availability and CDN if possible
```

### No Metadata API Required! 
✅ **Simplified**: The contract generates all metadata on-chain including:
- Token name and description
- Minter wallet address as trait
- Drawing date as trait
- Soulbound status

## Step 3: Frontend Configuration (Updated)

### 1. Environment Variables
Create `.env.local`:
```
REACT_APP_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=137
```

### 2. Update Contract Address
In your React app, replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE` with your deployed contract address.

### 3. Get ThirdWeb Client ID
1. Go to [ThirdWeb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Create new client ID
4. Add your domain to allowed origins

## Step 4: Testing & Deployment

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Test on Polygon Mumbai testnet first
# Get test MATIC from Mumbai faucet
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting provider
# Recommended: Vercel, Netlify, or IPFS
```

### Frontend Hosting Options
1. **Vercel** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **IPFS** (Fully Decentralized)
   ```bash
   # Build and upload to IPFS
   npm run build
   # Upload build folder to IPFS
   ```

## Step 5: Admin Functions & Management

### Emergency Controls
The contract includes several admin-only functions for managing the lottery:

```javascript
// Pause minting (emergency stop)
await contract.call("pause");

// Resume minting
await contract.call("unpause");

// Extend drawing date (cannot reduce)
const newDrawingDate = Math.floor(new Date('2025-02-01T23:59:59Z').getTime() / 1000);
await contract.call("setDrawingDate", [newDrawingDate]);

// Update image URI if needed
await contract.call("updateBaseURI", ["ipfs://QmNewImageHash"]);

// Withdraw any ETH sent to contract
await contract.call("withdrawETH");
```

### Max Supply Management
- **Hard Cap**: 10,000 NFTs maximum (cannot be changed)
- **Automatic Stop**: Minting stops when max supply reached
- **Progress Tracking**: Frontend shows supply progress

### Drawing Date Rules
1. **Extension Only**: Can only extend, never reduce drawing date
2. **Future Only**: New date must be in the future  
3. **Owner Only**: Only contract owner can modify
4. **Event Logging**: All changes logged on-chain

## Step 6: Contract Verification & Security

### 1. Verify Contract on PolygonScan
- Use ThirdWeb dashboard or manually verify
- Ensures transparency and trust

### 2. Security Checklist
- [ ] Test soul-bound restrictions
- [ ] Verify one-mint-per-wallet limitation
- [ ] Test metadata generation with minter address
- [ ] Ensure proper access controls
- [ ] Test burning functionality

## Step 6: Legal Considerations

### Important Legal Notes for Lottery/Prize Systems

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Since this is for a "PolyPrize" lottery system, be aware of legal requirements:

1. **Gambling Regulations**
   - Lottery laws vary by jurisdiction
   - Some regions require licenses for prize drawings
   - Consider legal consultation for compliance

2. **Terms of Service**
   - Clearly define NFT utility and limitations
   - Explain soul-bound nature
   - Include dispute resolution mechanisms

3. **Privacy Considerations**
   - Wallet addresses in metadata are public
   - Consider privacy implications
   - GDPR compliance if applicable

### Recommended Legal Framework
```
1. Terms of Service clearly stating:
   - NFT is soul-bound (non-transferable)
   - One mint per wallet limitation
   - Prize/lottery participation rules
   - Jurisdiction and governing law

2. Privacy Policy covering:
   - Wallet address collection and use
   - Metadata storage and access
   - User rights and data handling
```

## Step 7: Advanced Features (Optional)

### 1. Whitelist/Allowlist
Add to contract:
```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public allowlist;
modifier onlyAllowlisted() {
    require(allowlist[msg.sender], "Not allowlisted");
    _;
}
```

### 2. Time-Limited Minting
```solidity
uint256 public mintStart;
uint256 public mintEnd;

modifier duringMintPeriod() {
    require(block.timestamp >= mintStart && block.timestamp <= mintEnd, "Minting not active");
    _;
}
```

### 3. Prize Integration
Connect to lottery system:
```solidity
interface ILotterySystem {
    function registerEntry(address participant, uint256 tokenId) external;
}

ILotterySystem public lotteryContract;
```
